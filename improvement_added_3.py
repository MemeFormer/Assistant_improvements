### Improvements Made:
#1. **Error Messages and Feedback:**
#   - Added better error messages for missing programs and commands.
#   - Added hints for missing commands or typos.
#
#2. **Command Parsing:**
#   - Improved query parsing to handle specific cases (e.g., `use cowsay with`, `i am looking for a picture`).
#
#3. **Program Availability Checking:**
#   - Utilized `which` command to check if specific programs like `fortune` or `cowsay` are installed.
#
#4. **Query Matching and Execution:**
#   - Used multiple matching techniques to execute the most relevant command based on the query.
#
#Feel free to refine further or specify additional features you would like to include.
